# airbnb-clone-project
# Project Overview
The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, full-stack web application designed to simulate the core features and architecture of a modern booking platform like Airbnb. Its primary purpose is to provide hands-on experience in building a scalable, secure, and feature-rich application from the ground up, covering both the server-side logic and the client-side user experience. It serves as a practical, real-world development exercise.

# Project Goals
The main goals of the project are to successfully implement and demonstrate proficiency in:
Full-Stack Development: Integrating the frontend and backend to create a seamless, end-to-end user experience.
Robust Backend System: Designing and building a scalable and secure API to handle user authentication, listing management, and booking transactions.
Database Design: Creating an efficient and normalized relational or non-relational database schema to store complex data relationships (users, listings, bookings, reviews).
User Authentication & Authorization: Implementing secure sign-up, login, and access control (e.g., users can only edit their own listings).
Core Features Implementation: Developing key functionalities like:
Creating, viewing, updating, and deleting property listings (CRUD operations).
Implementing a search and filtering mechanism.
Handling booking requests and managing date availability.
Processing user reviews and ratings.
Application Security: Applying best practices to secure the application against common web vulnerabilities.
Deployment: Setting up the application on a live server for public access and testing.

# Suggested Tech Stack
Frontend	React (with Vite or Next.js)	A fast, component-based JavaScript library for building the dynamic and interactive user interface (UI).
Styling	Tailwind CSS or Styled Components	A modern approach to styling for rapid, utility-first UI development.
Backend	Django (Python)	A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It's ideal for a transactional application.
API	Django REST Framework (DRF)	The industry standard for building powerful and flexible RESTful APIs on top of Django. It simplifies serialization, authentication, and view creation.
Database	PostgreSQL or MySQL	A powerful, relational database (RDBMS) that works seamlessly with Django's ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) to manage complex data like listings, bookings, and user profiles.
Authentication	DRF Simple JWT or Django Allauth	Used to handle secure sign-up, login, and stateless user session management via JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for the API.
Media/Storage	AWS S3 or Cloudinary	Necessary for storing user-uploaded media like property photos, separating media files from the application server.
Deployment	Vercel/Netlify (Frontend) and Render or Heroku (Backend/DB)	Platforms to host the frontend and run the Python/Django backend and database.
