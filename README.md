## Key Relationships
The connections between these tables are crucial for defining how the application works:
| **Entity (Table)** | **Purpose**                                                          | **Key Fields**                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User**           | Stores information for both Guests (who book) and Hosts (who list).  | `user_id (PK)`, `email`, `password_hash`, `first_name`, `is_host (Boolean)`                                                           |
| **Listing**        | Represents the property being offered for short-term rental.         | `listing_id (PK)`, `host_id (FK → User)`, `title`, `description`, `price_per_night`, `location`, `max_guests`                         |

| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User Management 👤**            | Handles the creation, authentication, and profiles for all users, distinguishing between Guests (who book) and Hosts (who list properties).                         | Establishes application security and access control, ensuring users can only perform authorized actions (e.g., only a host can create a listing, and a user can only edit their own profile). |
| **Property Management 🏠**        | Encompasses the complete lifecycle for a listing, including creation, detailed description, photo uploads, pricing, and status updates (CRUD operations).           | Core function for Hosts, providing tools necessary to upload and manage the inventory (available homes) that the platform is built upon.                                                      |
| **Search & Filtering 🔍**         | Allows users to browse listings based on criteria like location, dates, price range, number of guests, and specific amenities.                                      | Ensures usability and discoverability — enabling Guests to quickly find relevant properties from the vast inventory, making the platform functional and efficient.                            |
| **Booking System 🗓️**            | Manages the reservation process, checking date availability, calculating the total price, processing the booking request, and confirming the reservation.           | Acts as the application's central transactional engine, handling date validation and payment logic — transforming a search into a confirmed stay.                                             |
| **Reviews & Ratings ⭐**           | Provides a mechanism for Guests to submit public feedback (rating and comment) after completing a stay at a property.                                               | Builds trust and transparency — offering social proof that helps future Guests make informed decisions and encourages Hosts to maintain quality.                                              |
| **Payment System Integration 💳** | Simulates or integrates with a real payment gateway (like Stripe or PayPal) to securely process financial transactions for bookings.                                | Addresses monetization and financial workflow — collecting payments from Guests and paying out Hosts, completing the business model loop.                                                     |

# API Security Overview
  ## Key API Security Measures
   API security is non-negotiable for a platform like an Airbnb Clone, as it directly deals with sensitive user data, financial transactions, and property access information. Without robust security measures, the entire business model and user trust are compromised.

Here is an overview of the key security measures and why they are crucial for your project.

 ### 1. Authentication (Who are you?):
   | **Measure**                  | **Explanation**                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**    | After a user logs in, the API issues a signed, short-lived Access Token (JWT). This token is sent with every subsequent request, verifying the user's identity without requiring them to send their password repeatedly. |
| **Secure Password Hashing**  | Never store raw passwords. Django's built-in authentication uses strong, one-way hashing algorithms (like **Argon2** or **bcrypt**) and salting to protect passwords even if the database is breached.                   |
| **Rate Limiting (on login)** | Restricts the number of failed login attempts from a single IP address or user within a given timeframe to prevent brute-force attacks.                                                                                  |

   
   ### 2. Authorization (What can you do?): 
   | **Measure**                          | **Explanation**                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** | Defines clear roles — *Guest* and *Host* — and restricts API access based on those roles. For example, the `POST /api/listings/` endpoint is only accessible to authenticated users with the **Host** role.                                 |
| **Object-Level Permissions**         | Ensures that users can only interact with data they own. For instance, a Host can only view, edit, or delete their own listings (e.g., a Host attempting to modify `listing_id=123` must be the `host_id` associated with that listing).    |
| **Input & Output Validation**        | Rigorously checks all incoming data to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL Injection). Likewise, only necessary data is returned in API responses to avoid **Excess Data Exposure** (for example, never including a user's password hash). |

### 3. Data Protection & Defense: 
| **Measure**                  | **Explanation**                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **HTTPS (TLS/SSL)**          | Enforces Transport Layer Security (TLS) to encrypt all data transmitted between the client (React app) and the server (Django API).                                               |
| **Rate Limiting (General)**  | Applies throttling to public or high-traffic endpoints (e.g., *Search* or *Booking*) to prevent abuse, reduce server load, and improve overall system stability.                  |
| **Secure Secret Management** | Stores sensitive values — such as the `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`, database credentials, and payment API keys — in secure environment variables, never in source code or version control. |

## Why Security is Crucial for Each Key Area
Security is not just a feature; it's the foundation of a trust-based platform. A single major breach can destroy the project's reputation and legality.
| **Key Project Area**               | **Security Concern**                                                                                                                      | **Crucial Impact of Security**                                                                                                                                                   |

| **User Data Protection**           | Storing PII (Personally Identifiable Information) such as names, email addresses, and home addresses for Hosts.                           | Security measures like strong hashing and TLS prevent identity theft and ensure compliance with data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR/CCPA).                                      |
| **Securing Booking & Payments**    | Handling financial transactions, payment integration keys, and preventing double-bookings.                                                | Proper authorization and secure payment gateway integration are vital to prevent financial fraud (e.g., unauthorized bookings) and ensure the integrity of the booking calendar. |
| **Protecting Property Management** | Ensuring only the rightful Host can edit or remove their listing, and preventing unauthorized access to a property’s calendar or pricing. | Object-level permissions prevent a griefing attack where a malicious user could take down or modify someone else’s listing, which is catastrophic for the Host’s business.       |
| **Platform Availability**          | Protecting against brute-force attacks on login and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks on the search API.                                    | Rate limiting ensures that the service remains available and responsive for legitimate users, safeguarding the overall user experience and business operations.                  |

# CI/CD Pipeline Overview
A CI/CD Pipeline is an automated set of steps and tools used to reliably and repeatedly deliver software changes (code updates, new features) from the development environment to the production environment. CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment.

| **Component**                           | **Explanation**                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Continuous Integration (CI)**         | The practice of frequently merging developer code changes into a central repository (e.g., GitHub) and running automated builds and tests each time a change is made. This helps catch integration errors early and maintain code stability. |
| **Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)** | Continuous Delivery ensures the application is always production-ready. Continuous Deployment takes it further by automating the entire release pipeline so that every successful change is automatically deployed to users.                 |

### Importance for the Airbnb Clone Project
CI/CD is crucial for a complex, transactional application like an Airbnb Clone for several reasons:

Reliability and Quality: Automated tests (run in the CI phase) catch bugs and ensure that new features haven't broken core functionality (like the booking process or payment integration) before they reach users.

Speed and Efficiency: It allows the team to deliver features rapidly. Instead of lengthy, manual deployments, the process is streamlined, enabling quick iterations and faster response to user feedback.

Consistency: Automating the build and deployment process (Dockerizing the application) ensures that the testing and production environments are identical, eliminating "it works on my machine" errors.
### Suggested CI/CD Tools

The tools selected should work seamlessly with your Django/React stack and integrate easily with cloud hosting services.
| **Tool Category**             | **Suggested Tool(s)**               | **Role in the Pipeline**                                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Version Control**           | GitHub / GitLab                     | The central repository for the code; it triggers the pipeline upon code commits (e.g., merging a feature branch).                                                     |
| **Automation Server (CI/CD)** | GitHub Actions or GitLab CI/CD      | Defines the workflow: runs tests, checks code quality, builds the containers, and pushes images.                                                                      |
| **Containerization**          | Docker                              | Packages the Django backend and the React frontend into portable, isolated containers, ensuring consistent behavior across environments (local, staging, production). |
| **Container Registry**        | Docker Hub or AWS ECR               | Securely stores the built and tested Docker images, making them available for deployment.                                                                             |
| **Deployment Target**         | Render, Heroku, or AWS/Google Cloud | The cloud service that pulls Docker containers from the registry and runs them as live, scalable services.                                                            |
